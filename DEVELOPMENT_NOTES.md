# Development Notes

## Project Setup Instructions

### Initial Environment Setup
```bash
# Create project directory
mkdir qpcr-analysis-toolkit
cd qpcr-analysis-toolkit

# Create virtual environment (REQUIRED)
python3 -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment (run this EVERY time you work on the project)
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Working with the Project
- **Always activate the virtual environment first**: `source venv/bin/activate`
- **Check if venv is active**: Look for `(venv)` in your command prompt
- **Deactivate when done**: `deactivate`

## Current Status (Day 1)

### âœ… Completed
- [x] Project structure and virtual environment
- [x] Core qPCR analyzer with Î”Î”Ct implementation
- [x] Sample realistic data (inflammatory response study)
- [x] Data validation and quality control
- [x] Technical replicate processing
- [x] Basic testing and validation
- [x] Git initialization and README

### ğŸ”„ In Progress
- [ ] Statistical analysis module (t-tests, multiple comparisons)
- [ ] Visualization module (publication-ready plots)
- [ ] Automated reporting (PDF/Excel outputs)
- [ ] Comprehensive examples and documentation

### ğŸ“Š Current Capabilities
The toolkit can currently:
1. Load and validate qPCR data from CSV files
2. Calculate technical replicate means
3. Perform Î”Ct normalization against reference genes
4. Calculate Î”Î”Ct values relative to control conditions
5. Compute fold changes using 2^(-Î”Î”Ct) method
6. Generate summary statistics by gene and condition
7. Handle missing data and quality control checks

### ğŸ§¬ Sample Results
With the included inflammatory response dataset:
- **IL6**: 14.9-fold upregulation in treatment vs control
- **TNF**: 7.0-fold upregulation in treatment vs control
- **GAPDH**: Stable reference gene across conditions

## Next Development Steps

   - User guide with biological context

3. **Portfolio Polish**
   - GitHub repository optimization
   - Demo scripts and datasets
   - Professional presentation materials

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Core Algorithm Validation
The Î”Î”Ct implementation follows the Livak & Schmittgen (2001) method:
- Î”Ct = Ct(target) - Ct(reference)  
- Î”Î”Ct = Î”Ct(treated) - Î”Ct(control)
- Fold Change = 2^(-Î”Î”Ct)

### Data Structure Decisions
- Used pandas for data manipulation (industry standard)
- Implemented technical replicate averaging before Î”Ct calculation
- Maintained sample traceability throughout the pipeline
- Designed for extensibility to multiple reference genes

### Quality Control Features
- Validates Ct values (must be >0 and <40)
- Checks for required reference genes and control conditions
- Handles missing technical replicates gracefully
- Provides detailed logging and user feedback

## Testing Results

### Current Test Coverage
- âœ… Data loading and validation
- âœ… Technical replicate processing  
- âœ… Î”Ct calculation accuracy
- âœ… Î”Î”Ct and fold change computation
- âœ… Summary statistics generation

### Performance Benchmarks
- Processes 36 data points in <1 second
- Memory efficient for datasets up to 10,000+ samples
- Handles multiple genes and conditions simultaneously
